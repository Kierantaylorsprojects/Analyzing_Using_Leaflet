# Analyzing_using_Leaflet

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. 

Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

In this project, I developed a way to visualize USGS data that will allow the user to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.
